# Dog-suite

**Dog-suite** is a Burp Suite extension that automatically replaces all images in HTTP responses with pictures of dogs.

## Why?

When testing websites with disturbing or graphic content, itâ€™s easy to get distracted (or traumatized). This 100% vibecoded extension solves this problem.
